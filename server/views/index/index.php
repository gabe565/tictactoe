This is a server demo for a potential implementation of the commitee's game protocal using the ReST architecture, 
it is only a prototype.
	

The server part is written in PHP, the database server is Oracle.
This could be moved to LAMP easily and hosted from a laptop.

The client could be written in any language but I used javascript/JQuery because it was simple to put online.
